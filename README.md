## But what is it?

The making of the COGIP app is a challenge given to us by our coachs at BeCode. Our goal: create a web app to help the accountants of the COGIP visualize invoices,contacts,clients and suppliers. All that while using an MVC architecture, a router, permissions and sessions setup, sanitization, validation, and implementing a CRUD (amongst other things). 

**time:~10days. from 28/10/2019 to 08/11/2019**

## What's inside?

A database,an MVC system, HTML, CSS, SQL queries, blood, tears, and little bits of dreams to make it live. Everything was created from A to Z, with written instructions and anot so accurate mockup as a base.
